/**
 * Auxio's media indexer.
 *
 * Auxio's media indexer is somewhat complicated, as it has grown to support a variety of use cases
 * (and hacky garbage) in order to produce the best possible experience. It is split into three
 * distinct steps:
 *
 * 1. Creating the chain of layers to extract metadata with
 * 2. Running the chain process
 * 3. Using the songs to build the library, which primarily involves linking up all data objects
 * with their corresponding parents/children.
 *
 * This class in particular handles 3 primarily. For the code that handles 1 and 2, see the layer
 * implementations.
 *
 * This class also fulfills the role of maintaining the current music loading state, which seems
 * like a job for [MusicStore] but in practice is only really leveraged by the components that
 * directly work with music loading, making such redundant.
